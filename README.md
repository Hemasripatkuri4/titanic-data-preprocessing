🚢 Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
Task 1 | AI & ML Internship

📌 Overview
This task focuses on the essential step of data cleaning and preprocessing using the classic Titanic dataset. This dataset contains information about passengers aboard the Titanic, and the goal is to prepare the data for machine learning models by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalizing data.

🎯 Objective
Clean and preprocess real-world data

Handle missing values effectively

Convert categorical data to numerical format

Normalize and scale the data

Prepare dataset for further machine learning tasks

📂 Dataset Used
Name: Titanic Dataset

Source: Kaggle Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

🔧 Key Steps Performed
Checked for null/missing values

Imputed missing values (Age, Embarked)

Removed irrelevant columns (e.g., PassengerId, Name, Ticket)

Converted categorical columns like Sex, Embarked using Label Encoding / OneHotEncoding

Normalized numerical features like Age and Fare

Split data into features and labels for model readiness

🧰 Tools & Libraries
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

Scikit-learn (for preprocessing)
